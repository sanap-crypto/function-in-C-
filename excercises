1) What is a function in C++? Explain its purpose and how it is used in programming.

2) How do you declare and define a function in C++? Provide an example of a function declaration and its implementation.

3) What are the differences between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference in C++ functions? Give examples illustrating each.

4) Explain the significance of return types in C++ functions. How do you define a function that doesnâ€™t return any value?

5) Describe the concept of function overloading in C++. Provide an example demonstrating the use of function overloading and its benefits in programming.



                                                        /* CODE RELATED */

1) Write a C++ function named 'calculateAverage' that takes in an array of integers and returns the average value of the elements. Provide an example of how you would use this function with a 
given array of numbers.

2) Create a recursive C++ function named 'factorial' that calculates the factorial of a given integer. Demonstrate the usage of this function by calculating the 
factorial of a user-input number.

3) Implement a C++ function named 'isPrime' that determines whether a given integer is a prime number or not. Provide an example by checking the primality of a few 
numbers using this function.

4) Write a program in C++ using Inline concept in which multiplies and subtracts given integers using 2 different inline functions.

5) Write a program in C++ that gives the maximum value between 2 numbers. Using functions only.
